# Striver's SDE Sheet

This repository contains my solutions to the problems in the Striver's SDE (Software Development Engineer) Sheet. The sheet is a curated collection of coding questions designed to improve your problem-solving skills and prepare you for technical interviews.

## About the Striver's SDE Sheet

The Striver's SDE Sheet is a popular resource among competitive programmers and job seekers preparing for software engineering interviews. It covers a wide range of topics including data structures, algorithms, dynamic programming, graph theory, and more. The sheet is divided into multiple sections, each focusing on a specific topic.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each corresponding to a section or topic in the Striver's SDE Sheet. Inside each folder, you will find the solutions to the problems within that section. The solutions are implemented in C++ and include the problem statements as comments at the beginning of each file.

## Using the Repository

You can browse the repository to explore the different sections and problems in the Striver's SDE Sheet. To view a specific problem's solution, navigate to the corresponding file in the relevant folder. Each solution is self-contained and can be compiled and run independently.

Feel free to explore the code, understand the solutions, and use them as a reference while solving the problems yourself. However, it is highly recommended to try solving the problems on your own before referring to the solutions.
